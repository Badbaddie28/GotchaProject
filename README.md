# Gotcha Project

A Flutter project.

## Project Description

For our second-year college project, my group is developing a mobile application using Flutter called "Gotcha." It’s a hide-and-seek game where players take on the roles of killer, police, or civilian. At the start of the game, each player is assigned a role. The gameplay involves 20-second rounds, during which the killer attempts to eliminate civilians. If the killer manages to eliminate all civilians without being caught, they win the game. It’s a thrilling concept that combines strategy and excitement, and we’re excited to see how it unfolds as we develop it further using Flutter.
